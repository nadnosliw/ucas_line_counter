# ucas_line_counter

A Google Docs add-on intended for tutors writing UCAS references and students writing personal statements for UCAS applications.  Word processors can already display the number of characters in a block of text but they may not count the number of lines in the same way as UCAS which can catch people out.
This add on creates new options to “Count number of lines” and “Format selection in UCAS lines” via the “UCAS Line Counter” menu in the “Add-ons” menu.  To use the Add-on select a block of text in the document and then navigate to one of the above options to count the number of lines or see the text line-formatted according to the UCAS methodology.

This is built in Google Apps Script (GAS).  Any pull requests will require transferring the code into the Apps Script editor in order to verify the classes behave as expected.
